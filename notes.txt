TTI files are 8 bit sensitive.  Superficially a text file, but include non-printing characters.

Create using whatever means you want... 

RobFax page processor scans TTI files in a "~/Templates" folder.

DE (description) field should contain the frequency to run & module name to call. 
e.g.  "1h newsindex"  "12h weather" "15m newsflash"

Remember spec only allows for 24 characters total.

Page data can contain field marks eg 1%-----------  3%17-----------------------------------
(field no. 1, field 3, extend for 17 lines, although this will really be module dependant.)

tags can also be used to indicate parameters
4%4-sport.tti#  etc.

These are as per AutoGnomic host frames!

saved pages are dropped into ~/Pages
